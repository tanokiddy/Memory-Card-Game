# Memory-Card-Game

## Objective

Create a simple game that tests a candidate's React and TypeScript skills. The game involves matching pairs of randomly generated shapes displayed on a grid. The candidate must demonstrate their ability to work with React components, state management, TypeScript types, and basic styling.

## Description

1. The game board consists of a 4x4 grid (total of 16 cells).
2. Each cell contains a randomly generated shape (circle, square, or triangle) in a random color (red, green, or blue).
3. The grid should have 8 pairs of matching shapes/colors.
4. When a user clicks on a cell, the shape/color is revealed.
5. The user can only reveal two cells at a time.
6. If the revealed shapes/colors match, the cells remain open.
7. If the revealed shapes/colors don't match, the cells are automatically hidden after a 1-second delay.
8. The game ends when all pairs are matched, and the user is shown a completion message with the number of attempts it took to finish the game.
